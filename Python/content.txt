In this we show that any particular conclusion follows from a set of general premises.
In this we generally isolate potential areas where error occurrence can be found. 
A hypothesis statement is given and we use error associated data to prove whether 
the given hypothesis is right or wrong. If nothing else works then we create 
alternate list of possible errors and associated causes and then we develop test 
cases to test them out and start eliminating the causes.
There are three types of questions everyone should ask for before correcting any 
error :
Is the cause of bug reproduce in other program ?
What next might be introduced by the fix that I’m about to make ?
What could we’ve done to prevent this bug in the first place ?
